# Context.md

**Date:** September 11, 2025
**Branch:** (assumed main)
**Commit:** (snapshot, not a git repo)

## Current Snapshot
- All source, config, and asset files scanned
- No About.md or Context.md previously existed
- Project is a React + Vite Monero P2P trading platform
- API is mocked; no backend integration yet
- All major features present in UI, but some are placeholders

## Summary of Findings
- Project structure is clean and modular
- State managed via Context API
- Routing via React Router
- UI built with Tailwind, framer-motion, custom components
- Data models defined in TypeScript
- Security/privacy features planned, some implemented (Tor, no KYC)
- No test coverage or backend integration
- No environment variable usage detected
- No About.md or Context.md files found before this analysis

## Top Priorities & Tasks
1. Integrate real backend API and database
2. Implement Tor and encryption features
3. Add unit/integration tests
4. Expand payment method support
5. Enhance dispute and notification systems
6. Improve accessibility and mobile UX

## Missing or Broken Files/Configs
- No README.md, About.md, or Context.md (now being created)
- No .env or environment variable usage
- No test files or test coverage
- No backend service integration

## Dependencies, Scripts, Build Status
- Dependencies: React, React DOM, React Router, framer-motion, lucide-react, @supabase/supabase-js
- DevDependencies: Vite, TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind, PostCSS, etc.
- Scripts: dev, build, lint, preview
- Build status: Ready for local dev; runs with `npm run dev`

## Acceptance Criteria for Ongoing Tasks
- All new features must follow TypeScript and React best practices
- Code must be modular, documented, and secure
- Privacy and security must be preserved
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Test coverage and documentation must be updated with each change
